                CubeKit wasn't built in a vacuum. It's the result of years spent in the trenches, building analytics 
                platforms with Cube.dev, learning what works, what doesn't, and what developers actually need. 
                Here's the story of how real-world experience shaped every component we've created.

            <h2>The Journey Begins: Our First Cube.dev Project</h2>
            <p>
                Two years ago, we embarked on building a comprehensive analytics platform for enterprise clients. 
                We chose Cube.dev as our semantic layer – and for good reason. The caching, the API design, 
                the way it handles complex data modeling – Cube.dev is genuinely excellent at what it does.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But as we started building the frontend, we quickly realized that while Cube.dev provides incredible 
                backend capabilities, the frontend was entirely up to us. And that's where the real work began.
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-info mb-6">
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="stroke-current shrink-0 w-6 h-6">
                    <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M13 16h-1v-4h-1m1-4h.01M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"></path>
                </svg>
                <span><strong>The Reality Check:</strong> Cube.dev gives you amazing APIs and data modeling capabilities, but building user-friendly interfaces that leverage these APIs effectively? That's a whole different challenge.</span>
            </div>

            <h2>The First Challenge: Query Building</h2>
            <p>
                Our first major hurdle was creating a query builder that business users could actually use. 
                We needed something that would let non-technical users explore data without writing code, 
                but also powerful enough for analysts to create complex queries.
            </p>

            <p>
                We started simple – dropdowns for measures and dimensions, basic filtering. But as we tested 
                with real users, we discovered the nuances that make or break a query builder:
            </p>

            <div class="bg-base-200 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
                <h4 class="font-semibold mb-3">What we learned about query builders:</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm">
                    <li><strong>Context matters:</strong> Users need to understand what measures work with which dimensions</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual feedback is crucial:</strong> Real-time query preview prevents frustration</li>
                    <li><strong>Drag & drop feels natural:</strong> But only when it's implemented thoughtfully</li>
                    <li><strong>Filtering is complex:</strong> Users want AND/OR logic, date ranges, and custom operators</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance perception:</strong> Loading states and progressive enhancement are essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile matters:</strong> Analytics aren't just for desktop anymore</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                After months of iteration, we had a query builder that users loved. But we realized we'd spent 
                more time on the UI than on our actual business logic. That was our first hint that something 
                was missing in the Cube.dev ecosystem.
            </p>

            <h2>The Schema Visualization Revelation</h2>
            <p>
                As our data model grew more complex, we faced another challenge: helping users understand 
                what data was available and how it all connected. Cube.dev's schema is powerful, but it's 
                not immediately intuitive to business users.
            </p>

            <p>
                We built an interactive schema visualizer that showed cubes, their relationships, measures, 
                and dimensions in a way that made sense to humans. The impact was immediate – user adoption 
                increased dramatically when people could actually see and understand the data structure.

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>The Dashboard Dilemma</h2>
            <p>
                Individual queries were great, but users wanted dashboards. They wanted to combine multiple 
                visualizations, create interactive filters that affected multiple charts, and arrange everything 
                in layouts that made sense for their workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building a dashboard system that works well with Cube.dev's caching and query optimization 
                turned out to be an art form. We learned about query coordination, state management, and 
                layout flexibility through countless iterations.
            </p>

            <div class="mockup-code mb-6">
                <pre data-prefix="// Our dashboard evolution"><code>Version 1: Fixed layouts (users hated it)</code></pre>
                <pre data-prefix="// "><code>Version 2: Complete freedom (too chaotic)</code></pre>
                <pre data-prefix="// "><code>Version 3: Guided flexibility (just right)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h2>The AI Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>
                As AI capabilities matured, we saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between natural language 
                and data queries. We built an AI chat interface that could translate questions like 
                "What were our top-selling products last quarter?" into proper Cube queries.
            </p>

            <p>
                The magic wasn't just in the AI – it was in how we integrated it with Cube.dev's semantic 
                layer. The AI understands our data model, knows about measure definitions and dimension 
                relationships, and can generate queries that actually make sense.
            </p>

            <div class="alert alert-success mb-6">
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="stroke-current shrink-0 h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

                </svg>
                <span><strong>The AI Advantage:</strong> By understanding Cube.dev's semantic layer, our AI can generate queries that are not just syntactically correct, but semantically meaningful.</span>
            </div>

            <h2>The "Aha!" Moment</h2>
            <p>
                The turning point came when we started our second major project. We found ourselves rebuilding 
                many of the same components – query builders, dashboard layouts, schema explorers. But this 
                time, we knew exactly what worked and what didn't.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's when we realized: every team building with Cube.dev faces these same challenges. 
                Everyone needs query builders, everyone struggles with dashboard layouts, everyone wants 
                to make their schema more accessible to users.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/10 to-secondary/10 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6 border border-primary/20">
                <h4 class="font-semibold mb-3 text-primary">💡 The CubeKit Vision</h4>
                <p class="text-sm mb-0">
                    What if we could package all our hard-won knowledge about building Cube.dev frontends 
                    into reusable components? What if other teams could skip the months of iteration we went 
                    through and jump straight to building their unique business logic?
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why CubeKit Components Are Different</h2>
            <p>
                CubeKit isn't just another UI library. Every component is designed specifically for Cube.dev, 
                with deep understanding of how the APIs work and how users actually interact with analytics data.

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                CubeKit is just the beginning. We're continuing to build and learn, and we want to share 
                that journey with the Cube.dev community. Every new project teaches us something new about 
                what developers need and how Cube.dev can be leveraged most effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're excited to see what you build with CubeKit, and we're even more excited to learn 
                from your experiences. The best components come from real-world usage, and we want CubeKit 
                to evolve based on the needs of the entire Cube.dev community.
            </p>
